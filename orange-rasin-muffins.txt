Gayla's Orange Rasin Muffins
Makes 30 small or 16 medium muffins.

0.5 cup unsalted butter
2 eggs
1 tsp. baking soda
1 cup buttermilk
2 cups flour
0.5 tsp. salt
1 cup rasins
Peel of one orange
0.5 cup sugar

1.	Preheat oven to 400 degrees Farenheit
2.	Butter small muffin tins.
3.	With an electric mixer, creat the sugar and butter until smooth.  Add the eggs and beat until fluffy.
