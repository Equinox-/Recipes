0.5 cup butter
0.33 cup sugar
1 egg
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons orange juice
0.25 teaspoon lemon extract
0.5 teaspoon vanilla extract
0.25 teaspoon salt
3-4 carrots (enough to make 0.5 cup cooked and mashed)
mini chocolate chips (optional)

1. Peel the carrots and cut them into coins.  Cover with water in a saucepan and cook over medium-high until soft, about 15 minutes.  Then, let the young chef mash the cooked carrots with a ptato masher and set aside.
2. Preheat the oven to 350Â° F.  Cream the butter or shortening and sugar in a bowl with the potato masher or a handheld electric mixer.  Mix in the egg, masked coooked carrots, lemon extract, and vanilla extract.  For easy creaming, make sure the butter is at room temperature.  If you're cooking with kinds under ten, use the potato masher (or mixer) to cream the butter and sugar.
3. Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into a separte bowl.  Next, fold the flour mixture into the carrot mixture.
4. Grease a cookie sheet with cooking spray or butter.  Drop teaspoons of the batter onto the reased cookie sheet, 1 inch apart.  Bake for 12-15 minutes.
5. While the cookies are baking, mix the glaze.  Whisk the confectioners' sugar and orange juice in a medium-size bowl.  When the cookies have cooled, use a butter knife to frost them, then add chocolate chips (if wanted.)
