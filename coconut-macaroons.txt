Ingredients

    2 large egg whites
    Pinch of salt
    1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
    2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
    2 bags shredded sweetened coconut (14-ounces each)
    Ice cream (optional) for Icearoons

Directions

    Heat oven to 300 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk egg whites and salt until frothy, about 2 minutes. Stir in condensed milk and vanilla. Using a rubber spatula, fold in coconut until well combined.

    Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick baking mats. Using a teaspoon and your fingers, form macaroons into 1 1/4-inch mounds about 1 inch apart.

    Bake until macaroons are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer baking sheets to a cooling rack; let cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to a week.

    You can also make Icearoon ice cream sandwiches by spooning ice cream onto the bottom of one macaroon and topping with another macaroon.
