Fry bacon until crisp in large kettle. Add onions and cook until they take on color. Next, stir in carrots, celery and parsley; cook over low heat for about 8 minutes. Drain any extra fat. Drain tomatoes, putting liquid into a measuring cup. Add chopped tomatoes to the mixture in kettle. Drain clams, mixing the liquid with tomato liquid.
